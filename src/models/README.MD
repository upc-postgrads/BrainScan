## Models

In this folder of the repository, we can find the two different models that we have implemented so as to perform our image segmentation task. A more detailed expanation of the scripts themselves can be found below but both are based on the __U-Net__ architecture.

The U-Net, which was first introduced in the paper _U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation_ ([see it here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf)), is mainly splitted into three parts: _downsampling path_, _bottleneck_ and _upsampling path_. The former consists on performing a sequence of convolutions iterspersed with max pooling operations whereas the latter carries out convolutions as well but interspersed with deconvolutions. Moreover, the feature maps obtained in the downsampling are concatenated with the ones obtained in the upsampling by means of the so called _skip connections_ so as to recover the information regarding the characteristic's localization.

The picture below depicts the U-Net architecture presented on the already mentioned paper.

### unet_tensorflow.py

In this script we can find another implementation of the U-Net but constructed from sratch by us using tensorflow. When developing the model, we followed quite faithfully the architecture given in the original paper. That is, we keep the same number of layers, perform the same operations (same convolutions, skip connections and activation functions) and use the parameters' inicialization given there. However, we also introduce little changes: we use zero padding so as to preserve the size of the feature maps, we add the option of performing batch normalization before the activation function and we also add an optional dropout layer after the bottleneck.


### unet_keras.py

In this script we can find an implementation of the U-Net using keras. This model was taken from the github repository <https://github.com/zhixuhao/unet/blob/master/model.py>. However, since our segmentation task consists in classifying each pixel as belonging to one of four possible classes, we have adapted the last convolutional layer so as to obtain an output with four channels. \
This model also follows the original paper with the only difference that it adds some dropout layers along the network and performs zero padding.
